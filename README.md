## 🔧 What I Do

I specialize in building custom software solutions for startups, SMEs, and enterprise clients. From backend architecture to polished frontend interfaces, I bring ideas to life while prioritizing security, maintainability, and real-world performance.

I’ve worked on:

- 📋 Custom internal systems for health, insurance, and HR management
- 🏦 Financial platforms for automation of investment products  
- 🧾 Document management system  
- 🌍 Multi-tenant platforms with region-specific configurations  
- 🧠 Workflow automation tools with multi-stage approvals and audit trails

> Most of my code is in private repositories due to NDAs, client confidentiality, and priporetory .  
> However, I'm happy to share selected code samples or walk through architecture decisions upon request.
